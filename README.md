#### Game Instructions
Welcome to Cosmic Crystal Collector.
You will be given a random number at the start of the game. There are four crystals on the game board. Each crystal has a designated value. By clicking on a crystal, you will add that value to your total score.

Your goal is to match your score to the computer's score without going over. The value of each crystal is hidden from you until you click on it. Each time the game starts, the crystal values will be shuffled. Good Luck!
